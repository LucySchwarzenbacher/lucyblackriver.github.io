Our Primary colours are `$white`, `$dark_gray` and `$main`. `$dark_gray` is only exclusively as a font-colour, `$white` is used as background-colour for our box elements and it is also a font-colour on certain occaions. The colour `$main` is the background-colour of the navigationbar, the footer and for the timer-section. Additionally `$main` is used as the colour for the section headlines.

Our accent-colour is mainly `$highlight`. It is used on elements like buttons, icons and important textelements. The colour `$light_green` is only used when post was uploaded successfully.

The remaining colours used in our project are `$light_grey` and `$grey`. `$light_grey` is the main backgound colour and `$grey` is the colour that is used for disabled buttons.
