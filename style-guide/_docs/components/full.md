{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/components/full/hall_of_fame.html' %}
Our *Hall of Fame* contains three of these boxes. The universal winners, disregarding the challenge, are displayed in the desired Hall of Fame. Naturally, the first place has the honor of receiving the gold medal, while place two and three get ahold of the silver and bronze one.


{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/components/full/countdown.html' %}
This is our countdown element and it displays when the next challenge expires.

{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/components/full/explanation.html' %}
This is one of our three explanation boxes. In these boxes is information on how the site works and where to find posts and challenges.

{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/components/full/challenge_list.html' %}
This is one of the list items where the active challenges are displayed. Here you can see the name of the challenge, when it ends, how many posts have already been uploaded, if you have submitted something or not and the upload button.
