## Description
The principle is rather simple: challenges and the associated timeframe is posed that the users artistically have to implement. The topic is randomly chosen - to keep it short: be open for surprises.

In our rating system, all of the artworks and corresponding challenges are listed and waiting for you to be discovered! You can show others some love by leaving a like for their masterpieces. 

Finally, the most liked posts are displayed in our virtual ranking and given the appreciation they deserve. We are eager to invite you to stumble over new-coming artists or even find talent and passion in yourself.


## Targetgroup
Colour Instinct is designed for creative masterminds and serves as a network for artists from all around the world. Even though there are numerous enormously talented people, only a few get the chance to share their art with others. Therefore, the main goal is that unnoticed artists receive the recognition they deserve.
