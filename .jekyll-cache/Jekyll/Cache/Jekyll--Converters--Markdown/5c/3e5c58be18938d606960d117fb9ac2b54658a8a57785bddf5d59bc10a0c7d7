<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>The principle is rather simple: challenges and the associated timeframe is posed that the users artistically have to implement. The topic is randomly chosen - to keep it short: be open for surprises.</p>

<p>In our rating system, all of the artworks and corresponding challenges are listed and waiting for you to be discovered! You can show others some love by leaving a like for their masterpieces.</p>

<p>Finally, the most liked posts are displayed in our virtual ranking and given the appreciation they deserve. We are eager to invite you to stumble over new-coming artists or even find talent and passion in yourself.</p>

<p>Colour Instinct is designed for creative masterminds and serves as a network for artists from all around the world. Even though there are numerous enormously talented people, only a few get the chance to share their art with others. Therefore, the main goal is that unnoticed artists receive the recognition they deserve.</p>
