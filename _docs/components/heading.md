info: Headings are used to highlight sections of content.

The application uses three headlines `h1`, `h2` and `h3`. `h1` is mainly used in combination with `h3` as *heading with subtitle* for different sections on the page. `h2` is used as the title of posts and challenges, as well as the headline for the profile details.
