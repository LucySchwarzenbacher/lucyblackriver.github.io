{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/components/link/link-default.html' %}

The default link is only used in the navigation bar.

{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/components/link/link-small.html' %}

We use the small links in our *challenge list* component to navigate to the ranking of the corresponding challenge.

{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/components/link/link-button.html' %}

As it is mentioned on the *Button* page, these links are mainly used for the login/logout and to navigate between specific posts and challenges.
