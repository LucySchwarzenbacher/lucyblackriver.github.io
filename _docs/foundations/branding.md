# Icons
{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/foundations/branding/icons.html' %}
These favicons are used as the logo of ColourInstinct. It is a very simple design, inspired by our vibrant green colour and is apparent in the tab of the browser. 

{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/foundations/branding/icons__hero.html' %}
These icons symbolise the primar functualities of ColourInstinct, which are being challenged, rated and consequently ranked. Not only do they inform users about the duties and possibilities, but also encourage them to take part. Therefore, they are displayed first when you come across the Website. 

{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/foundations/branding/icons__action.html' %}
Whether an action has been successfull or not, the corresponding icon appears with an adequate message. 

{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/foundations/branding/icons__medals.html' %}
The three medals are used in context of the overall *Hall of Fame*. In other words: the universal winners, disregarding the challenge, are rewarded with the corresponding medals in the desired *Hall of Fame*. Naturally, the first place has the honor of receiving the gold medal, while place two and three get ahold of the silver and bronze one.

{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/foundations/branding/icons__stats.html' %}
The following components are incorporated in the profile view. They provide confidential information about the total likes, days of membership and uploads of the logged-in user.

{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/foundations/branding/icons__like.html' %}
The hearts are crucial components of the rating systematic, as they provide the information whether a post is liked or not. This enables the user to either like or unlike and receive immediate optical feedback by an empty or filled heart. 

{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/foundations/branding/icons__status.html' %}
These icons are used in context of the upload of posts for a specific challenge. Evidently, the *checked icon* confirms that an upload has been submitted whereas the *question mark* is an indicator that no picture has been handed in yet.

{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/foundations/branding/icons__filter.html' %}
The filter icon is used in favor of the bar to increase its visibilty and appearance. 

{% include pattern_block.html url='/src/patterns/foundations/branding/icons__camera.html' %}
In case of a missing picture, the *camera icon* acts as a placeholder.
