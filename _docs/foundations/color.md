The primary colours are `$white`, `$dark-gray` and `$main`. `$dark-gray` is exclusively utilized as a font colour. `$white` is used as background-colour for box elements and furthermore acts as a font-colour on certain occasions e.g. to establish a definite contrast to a dark background. The colour `$main` is the background-colour of the navigationbar, the footer and the countdown section. Additionally, the headings `h1`, `h2`, `h3` are also coloured in the dark grey-blue.

The accent-colour is mainly `$highlight`. It is used on elements like buttons, icons and important text elements. The colour `$light-green` only appears when a post was successfully uploaded.

The remaining colours used in the project are `$light-grey` and `$grey`. `$light-grey` can be found on the backgound colour, whereas `$grey` is the colour used for disabled buttons.
